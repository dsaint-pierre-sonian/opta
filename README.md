# opta
A simple ruby script for CAPSL OPTA exports.

Run `bundle install` to grab all the necessary gems for this script. You will need ruby (duh) and also phantomjs. To download phantomjs, you need homebrew installed. First, `brew update`, then `brew install phantomjs`.

For help, run `./opta_export.rb -h`.
